Countries around the world are tightening up on Global Telecommunication Regulations. Sure, you may think to call someone internationally is as simple as clicking a button. But in our post-GDPR and CCPA world, each phone number you provision or use must follow a set of constantly evolving rules and regulations that vary from country to country. 

Fortunately, Salesloft’s Dialer follows these regulations diligently. So numbers that have already been provisioned are good to go. Keep on dialing! 

But if you’re provisioning a new international number, how can you be sure that it fits the bill?

Regulation standards are kept through a phone number approval process. This process involves providing various levels of documentation to carriers or local enforcement agencies based on country regulations.

In order to make this process as fast as possible (and get you dialing quickly), we need your help in gathering and providing the necessary identity documentation.

When we receive your documentation, we’ll submit it all to our provider for review. Once approved, we can provide your team with the desired numbers.

In this article, you will learn how the standard number provisioning process works and specific guidelines for the top 10 most popular countries to provision Salesloft numbers, including:

How to Provision an International Number

In order to make the process of provisioning an international number as fast as possible (and get you dialing quickly), we need your help in gathering and providing the necessary identity documentation. 

Things to Note: On average, it takes 5 business days to provision international numbers. However, there are some numbers that might take longer due to additional local government restraints.

Follow these steps to provision an international number: 

Find the country you would like to provision a number from below or in the Phone Number Regulatory Requirements documentation.
Things to Note: In rare instances, numbers in that area may not be available. If this occurs, we are put on a waiting list until the country's local government provides them with a number
Gather the necessary information. For example, if you are applying for a German number, you will need to provide business information for proof of identity and proof of a local address.
Contact Salesloft's support team with your number request. Provide the necessary documentation that specifies the city and country number you are seeking.
Our Support team will take care of the number provisioning process with our third-party Dialer provider.
Once your number has been provisioned, we will contact you.
