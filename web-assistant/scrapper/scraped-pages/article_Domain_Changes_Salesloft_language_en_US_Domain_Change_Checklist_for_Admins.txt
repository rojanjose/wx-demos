If your company is going through an acquisitions, mergers, or rebranding, they may also be looking at changing the company domain. Changing the domain of your company can be a daunting task since you have to make sure it's changed everywhere, including in your Salesloft instance. 

To ease your worries a little bit and help make the domain change a little easier, we have prepared this guide with the steps that should be taken if/when your company changed domains. The list will walk you through Salesloft personal settings, email, Salesforce integration, etc.

In this article, you'll find the following
Domain Change Checklist for Admin
Domain Change Checklist for Users
 
Domain Change Checklist for Admins
As a Salesloft Admin, it's up to you to manage team settings. If a domain change is in progress there are multiple aspects of Salesloft that will need to be edited. You will be taking action in the following focus areas: 
General: Team and payment info
Email Domain & Website
Salesforce
Content
Calendars and Meetings
All of these steps should be initiated at least one to two weeks prior to your go-live date. That way you can test and verify every thing is running smoothly before the new domain is launched. 

Things to Note: Suggested best practices are denoted by an asterisk (*). We strongly recommend these steps, but they are not technically required for your users to continue using. 

 General


 	

Share User instructions

	

Several actions are required by your end-users. Please be sure to share the checklist ahead of time and emphasize the importance of these steps.

Review Email Deliverability Checklist

	

Share with your IT team as applicable to review.


 	Update Live Website Tracking	If you’re creating a totally new website under the new domain, you want to make sure the Live Website Tracking code is still in your website headers. Then you’ll also want to add the new domain to the tracked domain list.


Salesforce

Domain Change Checklist for Users
Since your company is updating their domain, you want to be sure that all of your Salesloft information matches the change. Imagine the confusion a potential buyer might have if there are multiple different names for your own company in your emails. Let's just say, it's better if you don't have to experience that. 

Once you receive these instructions from your team admin (or whenever your team admin gives you the ok), follow the steps below to keep all of your Salesloft personal settings and content up to your professional standard. 

Make sure to take these steps the day your new domain goes live!
