As of July 2020, data history rolls back 18 months. Prior to July 2020, Salesloft data went back as far as January 2018.

There are some exceptions to the data contained. For example, if a Person replies to an email that was originally sent in 2009 (which would be really impressive), the metrics attributed to that email are available.
