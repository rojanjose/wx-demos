HubSpot's integration with Salesloft allows you to decide the level of contact mapping plus custom fields your team desires. All of your sales tactics will be executed inside of Salesloft and changes to those contact fields will update in your HubSpot CRM, keeping your data clean to focus on your accounts and opportunities.

To setup the integration, you will need to connect and use Data Sync by HubSpot. For more information on Data Sync, check out the Connect and use HubSpot data sync Knowledge Base article. 

Here’s what you get with Data Sync by HubSpot:
Two-way sync: Data is shared between Salesloft and HubSpot in real time
Default field mappings: Set-up is quick with out-of-the-box field mappings already created for you
Historical syncing: Your existing data will sync right away, and updates will sync as they happen
Learn more about the Salesloft and HubSpot integration on the Salesloft App Directory.

For help or assistance with the integration, contact HubSpot customer support.
