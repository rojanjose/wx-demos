Failing CRM Activities Table
Filter CRM Activities by User 
The User filter allows you to filter by a specific user. This way, if a certain user was experiencing issues with between their CRM and Salesloft, you can view only errors that occurred between their instance.

The User filter includes the following options:
A specific team member
Your entire team
Just your own
 
Filter CRM Activities by Date (Admins Only)

The Failed CRM Activities Date filter lets you view the failed CRM activities by the date the log was attempted. This is particularly helpful if any error occurred on a certain date and you would only like to see those records or you want to see the number of logs that took place during a period of time.

Things to Note: Admins can select a date range of up to 90 days in the past.

The Date filter includes the following options: 

Today
Last 2 Days
Last 7 Days
Last 14 Days
Last 30 Days
Last 60 Days
Last 90 Days
Custom Date Range: Enter the Start and End dates for the range you would like to see.

When you select a date range, hit Apply to set the filter. 

Filter CRM Activities by Error Theme (Admins Only)

The Error Theme filter categorizes sync errors into various error themes. This way, you can select a theme and view any errors that fit the error classification. When you filter by an error theme, you gain visibility into how big or small an issue is. You can also gain further understanding into the reason an error is happening across a series of logs.

To apply the Error Theme filter, search and/or select for a certain theme from the Error Theme dropdown. Once you click a theme, the filter will be applied to the list. 

You can clear the filter by clicking the X in the filter box at the top of the list view. 

Retry Past 30 Days
When activities fail, a team admin may need to go into your CRM and address the error causing the failure. Once that adjustment has been made, you can retry to attempt the log to your CRM. 

The Retry Past 30 Days option allows you to attempt to sync all failing activities from the past month. If there are any eligible retry activities from the past 30 days, the Retry Last 30 Days button will appear at the top of your list view.

When there are no errors or the errors fall outside the 30 day window, the message No items from the past 30 days is shown.


Retry Failed Activities from the CRM Failed Activities Log
The Failing CRM Activities filters can help you quickly identify potential errors that could negatively impact your activity logs. If you notice errors occurring for multiple logs, you can use the error messages to help resolve the issue. After the error is fixed, you can retry the failed activities.

To retry failed activities, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Failed CRM Activities Log. You can filter the table by a user or error theme if you want to view a certain type of error. 


2. Once the filter is in place, go to the table and hover over the Error column to see the complete error message. 

Best Practice Tip: When you hover over the message, you have the option to Copy Error. Select copy error and paste the error message into a search engine. The CRM or other sources may have instructions on how to correct the error. 

3. Correct the error. Usually this will require some work inside of your CRM. 

4. In your Failed CRM Activities Log, check the boxes for each line item you would like to retry. You can also select a full page worth of logs. When you select a check box, the Retry Sync button will appear at the top of the list. 

Things to Note: The maximum number of items on a page is 100. If you have a list of errors that is greater than 100 items, you will need to perform the retry for each page. 

5. Click Retry Sync. A pop up will show you the number of items being retried and other relevant details. Clicking on Cancel or X closes the window without the retry being executed. You can click View retry tips to learn more in Troubleshooting Guide article. 

 

6. Click Retry. When the retry is successful, a blue notification displaying the number of items being retried will appear. 

If none of the items fit the retry criteria, a Red notification will appear with the reason for the failure.
