Each user can opt out of the Weekly Summary Email individually by following these steps:
Inside Salesloft, click your name in the upper-right corner of the platform and select Settings. You will land in your Personal Profile settings.
In your Profile settings, scroll down the page to the Weekly Summary Email.
Turn the Weekly Summary Email toggle off to opt out of the emails. If you would like to enable the email, toggle this setting on. 
Click Save Profile at the bottom of the page. 
 
The link to the Profile Settings page is also at the bottom of each email. You can access it by clicking Update your email preferences.

Things to Note: The Weekly Summary Email is managed at the user level. Team Admins cannot disable the email for their users.
