Content
From mapping default and standard fields to creating custom fields, a large portion of time as a new Salesloft customer can be spent setting up your team's instance between your CRM and Salesloft. 

Fortunately, Salesloft created a feature that auto-maps standard fields to decrease your set up time.

Things to Note:
IMPORTANT - ORDER MATTERS: If you or any admin on your team starts mapping fields BEFORE you select Dynamics as the CRM Type, you WILL NOT be able to take advantage of the auto-mapping. Our system will see fields mapped and will respect them.
Due to the reason above, auto-mapping will not impact current customers with any field mappings. All current field mappings will be respected and stay intact.
If you are a customer that has never had CRM Sync enabled, you can auto-map fields using the CRM Type setting. The auto-map feature will map standard fields in an inbound from CRM to SL direction. You can edit this mapping's direction or remove the mapping, if needed.

In this article, you will learn how fields are auto-mapped and the fields included in auto-mapping For Dynamics, including:
Auto-Map Standard Dynamics Fields
Auto-Mapped Person Fields: Dynamics Lead Fields
Auto-Mapped Person Fields: Dynamics Contact Fields
Auto-Mapped Dynamics Account Fields
Auto-Mapped Dynamics Opportunity Fields
 
Auto-Map Standard Fields 
To auto-map standard fields from Salesloft, follow these steps: 
In Salesloft, click your name in the upper right corner to your  and select your Team settings. Then go to the CRM Sync settings.
Choose Dynamics as your CRM Type.
A window will pop up asking you to confirm the CRM Type. Click Confirm. Once you select a CRM Type, the field options will be greyed out. 
Connect Salesloft to your Dynamics instance.
Connect Salesloft to your CRM Main Connector account.
Navigate to the Field Configuration Page to see your Auto-Mapped Standard Fields and verify the mapping is exactly how you want it to be. The fields direction will be set to import information from Dynamics into Salesloft. If you want to edit the field or the direction, make those changes on the Field Configuration page. 
 
Auto-Mapped Person Fields: Dynamics Lead Fields
Dynamics customers using Salesloft have the option to auto-map standard fields. To learn how to enable field auto-mapping check out the CRM Field Configuration article. 

Things to Note: DO NOT manually map any fields if you would like to use the auto-map feature. If any fields have been previously mapped, auto-mapping will not be applied to your instance, and you will have to map all of your own fields. 

Fields will be mapped using the CRM into Salesloft direction option. If you want to change the direction, you can edit the field. Field edits can also include changing the field that is mapped or deleting the field entirely

Auto-Mapped Dynamics Opportunity Fields
Salesloft automatically maps 10 fields for customers. See below for a list of fields that will map automatically.

As with all auto-mapped fields, these fields are all mapped inbound by default, so if your team would like to make any field map bidirectionally, or to map any fields not included in our auto-mapped fields, go to the Opportunity Field Configuration in Salesloft to manage that configuration.
