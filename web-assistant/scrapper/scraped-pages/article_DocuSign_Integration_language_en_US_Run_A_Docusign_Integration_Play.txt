The DocuSign Integration brings DocuSign signals into Salesloft Rhythm where you can perform the right actions for your workflow.

 

This integration works by connecting your Salesloft and DocuSign accounts. Establishing this connection allows Salesloft to receive signals from DocuSign, such as a customer opening a contract. Your admin can create DocuSign Plays to designate specific actions that should follow a DocuSign signal, such as a follow-up email. 

 

By leveraging the DocuSign Integration, you can access all the information you need right inside Salesloft and make the best decisions for your workflow. 

 

Things to Note: The DocuSign Integration is available for DocuSign accounts that have access to Salesloft Connect, which DocuSign makes available to Business Pro accounts, Enterprise Pro level accounts, and as an add-on.
