Meeting Links direct email recipients to your calendar where they can view your availability and book a meeting. You can add meeting links to your emails, one-off messages, descriptions, and even social posts (if you're really ambitious).


 

By default, you have a meeting link that consists of your Salesloft team name, your first name, and your last name. You can use the default meeting link, or edit it according to your preference.

 

To edit your meeting link, follow these steps: 

Click your name in the upper right corner to open your settings.
Select Calendar under your Personal Settings.
From the Calendar Settings, select the Meeting Setup tab.
Select Edit in the Meeting Link tile. The edit button will switch to a text box where you can change the end portion of your meeting link.
Edit the end of the URL.
Click the green checkmark. 

 

Things to Note: To obtain a copy of your meeting link, click the click the copy icon before your meeting link url.
