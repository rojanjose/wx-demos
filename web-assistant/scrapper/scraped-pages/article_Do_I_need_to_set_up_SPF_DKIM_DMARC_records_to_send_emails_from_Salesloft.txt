SPF/DKIM/DMARC Records are not needed to send emails from Salesloft. 

Salesloft connects directly to your Outlook or Google Workspace mailbox. When you send an email through Salesloft, the email is sent via the provider’s mail server and inherits the same email authentication you have already configured on your domain. 

Lofted emails are sent and authenticated the same as if you were to send an email natively from your mailbox.
