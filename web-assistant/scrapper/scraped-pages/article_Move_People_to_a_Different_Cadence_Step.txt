Moving People to a new step is very similar to skipping a step, but with a little more control.

Say you take over a coworker's Lead assignments who have already been communicated with. Once you add them to your Cadence, they don't need to run through steps 1-5, so you can collectively move the People to step 6.

To move People to a new Cadence step, follow these instructions:
Select a Cadence. Inside a Cadence, select the People tab.
Filter and sort your People list (if necessary).
Select specific People or all the People you want to move. 
Click on Cadence Actions (rocket ship icon).
From the Cadence Actions dropdown, select Move to Step. The Move to Step popup window will appear.
From the dropdown, select where you would like the move the People.
Click Move.
