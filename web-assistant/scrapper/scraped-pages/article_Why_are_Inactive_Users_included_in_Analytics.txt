Inactive users and deleted users still appear in analytics so you can see the source of where activities are attributed.

Keeping inactive user's data is particularly helpful if a previously active user sent an email to a Person and the Person opens, clicks, or replies to the email months after they’ve been inactive. Your team can keep track of the original message and continue the call.
