Salesloft allows you to easily view the metrics for one template from the stats listed to the right of the template. But in the event that you want to view and share all of those metrics, you can export the data as a CSV file.

The CSV file will include the following template information:
Title
Subject
Body
Owner
# Sent Emails
# Email Views
# Email Clicks
# Email Replies
% Email Views
% Email Clicks
% Email Replies
Tags

To export template metrics, follow these steps:
Select the templates you want to export metrics for, or select all templates using the select all feature from the Template list view.
Navigate to the Template Actions dropdown menu and select Export Templates.
A popup will appear asking if you are sure you want to export metrics for the selected template(s). Click Export.
The export will be downloaded. Click the download to view the metrics.
