If you've taken a look at the Field Configuration tab on a Person or Accounts Details page, you know there are a lot of fields available to you.

Things to Note: If you are new to Salesloft and haven't mapped any fields yet, start with our Auto-Map Standard Dynamics Fields guide. This will map the recommended Dynamics fields for you!

You may be wondering what do some of these fields mean and, more importantly, which ones do you need to map?

The rule of thumb is to complete your field configuration based on the information and data your team values the most.  
However, for those of you who have started mapping fields and would like to know which fields you can gain the most value from, here are the lists of fields that you will want to consider mapping per Microsoft Dynamics object: 
Recommended Person Fields
Required and Recommended Account Fields
Recommended Call and Email Field Mappings

Required and Recommended Account Fields
The Account fields contain a couple of required fields that need to be mapped.

Company Name is a required field in Salesloft. You must map these fields to import Accounts from Dynamics. 

Outside of the Company Name, your account field mapping boils down to team preference. Which fields and details matter the most to your team?

To start your Account field mapping, here are the fields we recommend for the most basic level of Account field mapping:
 
Salesloft Field Name	Dynamics Field Label	Dynamics Field Name (API Name)
City	Address 1: City	address1_city
Country	Address 1: Country/Region	address1_country
Description	Description	description
Name (Required)	Account Name	name
Industry	Industry	industrycode
Phone	Main Phone	telephone1
Postal Code	Address 1: ZIP/Postal Code	address1_postalcode
State	Address 1: State/Province	address1_stateorprovince
Street	Address 1: Street	address1_line1
Domain	Website	websiteurl
Owner Crm ID	Owner	_ownerid_value
Recommended Call and Email Field Mappings
If you have email and call activity logging enabled in the CRM Sync tab of your Personal Settings, below are the recommended field mappings.

We would recommend that you also download the Managed Solution Download for Dynamics so that you are able to capture Cadence information (Cadence name, most recent Cadences - name/last completed step/next due date), engagement statistics (clicked count, replies count, viewed count), and call and email specifics (ex. call sentiment & disposition, email template title, actual end/start, etc.).

If you do not download the Managed Solution, the field mappings below will recommend custom field type options that you will need to create to map these fields appropriately.
