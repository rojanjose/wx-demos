Content
Email Sentiments offer reliable metrics to understand email performance, e.g. positive replies and objection replies vs. opens and replies.  

While measures like reply rate are helpful, they don’t really say what kind of replies are being received. By leveraging Email Sentiments, you have extra insight into what content is working best, which team member is getting the better replies and how to make improvements. 

Salesloft offers specific reports that focus on Email Sentiments. The available reports include: 
Email Sentiments by User Report
Emails Sentiments Over Time Report

Emails Sentiments Over Time Report
The Email Sentiments Over Time Report was created with set filters to show a breakdown of Email Sentiments and email performance that happen each day. You may think it looks very similar to the Email Sentiments by User report, and you’d be correct since it shares more of the same parameters, with one key difference. This focuses on daily performance versus the performance of each rep.  

The pre-set filters include: 
View: Standard
Display By: Day
Date: This Week
User: Users in Specific Groups (includes whichever group or parent group and children group(s) assigned to the user)
The data can be adjusted by using Analytics Filters. When you change any of these filters, you can save the page view to Create Custom Reports.

Outside of the standard filter options, you can add additional filters to your report. The Email Sentiments by User Report's additional filters include: 
Sent
Delivered
% Personalized
% Opened
% Replied
