An Error Occurred When Executing a Flow Interview
After installing the Insight from Salesloft dashboard package, if there are existing automated flow definitions in Salesforce that conflict with the flow definitions included in the Insight from Salesloft package, we recommend deactivating both the Process Builders and Flow included in the package:
Process Builders:
Populate Primary Contact Opportunity Field from Contact Roles (API Name: Populate_Primary_Contact_Opportunity_Field_from_Contact_Roles)
Insight from Salesloft Update Salesloft Most Recent Cadence Fields on Opportunity (API Name: Insight_from_Salesloft_Update_Salesloft_Most_Recent_Cadence_Fields_on_Opportunity)
Salesforce Flow:
Auto_Populate_PrimaryContact_from_Contact_Role_Object (API NAME: Auto_Populate_PrimaryContact_from_Contact_Role_Object)
What will happen if I deactivate these flow definitions?
Deactivating the Processes & Flow means you are deactivating the process that accounts for Contact to Opportunity Cadence attribution.

Things to Note: If you are using Leads primarily in Salesloft, the Processes are not needed and instead you can leverage Lead Conversion Field Mapping for Cadence to Opportunity attribution reporting.
 
How to Deactivate the Flow
Go to Set up.
Under Create > Workflow and Approvals > Flow
From the Flow page, select Auto_Populate_PrimaryContact_from_Contact_Role_Object.
From page, click Deactivate in the Flow versions table.
How to Deactivate the Process Builder Automation
If you don't want to leverage the process and flow from the Insight package into your Salesforce org, or an error occurred and you need to remove the process, follow these instructions:
Under Create > Workflow and Approvals > Process Builder
From the My Processes page, select the blue arrow to the left of Populate Primary Contact Opportunity Field or Insight from Salesloft Update Salesloft Most Recent Cadence Fields on Opportunity.
Under the version, click Deactivate.
