In order for Calendar Sync to work it must be enabled by a team admin and then set up by each user.

If your calendar isn't syncing after you set up your email, a block on the backend may be preventing calendar retrieval.

If this occurs, you will see an error message that prompts you to contact Salesloft Support. 



You can select the green Contact Support button to submit a support ticket regarding this issue. You may also attempt to sync your calendar from the Calendar page in your Personal Settings.
