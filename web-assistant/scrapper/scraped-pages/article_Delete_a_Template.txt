For templates that you want completely removed from your Salesloft record, you have the option to delete them. Deleted templates cannot be recovered and the data is gone.

Things to Note: Salesloft best practice is to archive previously used templates . 

Deleting a template may be useful for templates that were created but never sent or templates that were used as tests for formatting. 

To delete a template, follow these steps:
Select the template or templates by clicking the checkbox next to their name.
Click the Trash icon. The Delete Template window will appear. 
Select Delete.
