The Forecast Weekly Trend chart compares your team’s triangulation values, or various Opportunity points, to your target revenue goal for a particular close date period. 

Triangulation values include the AI Forecast (if enabled), Forecast, and Probable Sum. These values are impacted when changes are made to an opportunity. Opportunity changes can occur frequently, especially within a close date period, and tracking these changes can show how your forecast has changed over time. 

The Weekly Trend chart gathers all of this data and makes it readily available inside the Weekly Trend panel. Here, your team can simplify your forecast workflow by identifying business trends and determining accurate goals to set. 

In this article, we will walk through the Weekly Trend chart, including:

Forecast Weekly Trend Chart Breakdown
The Weekly Trend chart plots your team’s triangulation rollup values to show how your forecast has changed over a period of time. 

Things to Note: The triangulation values may differ

The values on the Weekly Trend chart are generated based on the close date period you select using the Close Date filter. By default, the Forecast Dashboard Filters show forecast metrics for your entire team for the current month. 

Once you set your filters, the Weekly Trend chart adjusts based on how your team’s triangulation values have changed over the close date period you selected. The close date period you selected is broken down into weekly increments across the bottom axis of the chart.

The Weekly Trend chart generates a dotted line to indicate your team’s target revenue goal. Use this line to compare your forecast metrics to your target revenue goal over the selected close date period. 



You can hover over any data point on the chart to open a detailed hover view. This detailed view shows you the specific triangulation values for that data point.

The hover details view contains the following for each data point:

AI Forecast: Suggested forecast numbers based on data trends. 
Forecast: The submitted forcast numbers for that period of time. 
Other Triangulation metrics: These will only appear if your team has added and configured other Triangulation metrics.
