Images in your signature appearing as attachments are often caused by Microsoft Office365 or Outlook email servers. If these servers don’t accept the images, they appear as attachments. 

One potential workaround, would be hosting or linking images so that your email server will accept the image. You can learn more about hosted/linked images and how to create them here . 

Once the embedded link is created, you can edit the image’s source to the new link. Then, send a test email to a personal email(ex. Yahoo/Gmail) to verify the images are embedding properly and make sure that the email is formatted properly.
