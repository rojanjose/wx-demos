Content
From mapping default and standard fields to creating custom fields, a large portion of time as a new Salesloft customer can be spent setting up your team's instance between your CRM and Salesloft. 

Fortunately, Salesloft created a feature that auto-maps standard fields to decrease your set up time.

Things to Note:
IMPORTANT - ORDER MATTERS: If you or any admin on your team starts mapping fields BEFORE you select Salesforce as the CRM Type, you WILL NOT be able to take advantage of the auto-mapping. Our system will see fields mapped and will respect them.
Due to the reason above, auto-mapping will not impact current customers with any field mappings. All current field mappings will be respected and stay intact.
If you are a customer that has never had CRM Sync enabled, you can auto-map fields using the CRM Type setting. The auto-map feature will map 47 standard fields in an inbound from CRM to SL direction. You can edit this mapping's direction or remove the mapping, if needed.

In this article, you will learn how fields are auto-mapped and the fields included in auto-mapping in Salesforce, including:
Auto-Map Standard Salesforce Fields
Auto-Mapped Salesforce Person Fields: Lead/Contact Fields
Auto-Mapped Salesforce Account Fields
Auto-Mapped Salesforce Opportunity Fields
Auto-Map Standard Salesforce Fields 
To auto-map standard fields from Salesforce to Salesloft, follow these steps: 
In Salesloft, click your name in the upper right corner to your  and select your Team settings. Then go to the CRM Sync settings.
Choose Salesforce as your CRM Type. As a new customer that has had no previous connections to a CRM, you will now have to choose between one of the following: Salesforce or No CRM. 
Thing to Note: If you are a Salesloft customers that has ever had a Salesforce CRM connection, You will not need to select the CRM Type. Your CRM Type will default to Salesforce.  
A window will pop up asking you to confirm the CRM Type. Click Confirm. Once you select a CRM Type, the field options will be greyed out. 
Set up your Personal CRM connection.
Connect Salesloft to your Salesforce Main Connector account or a Salesforce Sandbox. 
Set your field level security in Salesforce.
Back in Salesloft, go to the Field Configuration Page to see your Auto-Mapped Standard Fields and verify the mapping is exactly how you want it to be. The field direction defaults to import information from Salesforce into Salesloft. If you want to edit the field or the direction, make those changes on the Field Configuration page.
