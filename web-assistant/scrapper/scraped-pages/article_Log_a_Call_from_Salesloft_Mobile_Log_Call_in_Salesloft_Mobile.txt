Salesloft Mobile allows you to log your call from your phone. This means you don't have to worry about forgetting what took place on the call if you're away from your desk. 

As soon as the call is complete, you can log the call using the Calls tab in the Mobile app (as long as you aren't driving).

The way you log your call will depend on whether the phone number you dialed is linked to a Person in Salesloft or not. We will walk through the process for both instances. 

In this article, you will learn about how to log a call in Salesloft Mobile, including:
