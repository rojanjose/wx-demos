Both Email and Call Sentiments gather qualitative data on your engagement. However, that’s where the similarities end. 
 
Email Sentiments use a machine learning model to suggest a sentiment based on a reply. Call sentiments are entirely based on how the USER logs the call—a machine learning model is not partaking in logging a call.
 
Also, Email and Call Sentiments differ in that each type of communication may result in a different action. 
 
For instance, call sentiments are more descriptive and detailed because users may take in more information while they are talking directly to prospects. Your team can even include custom sentiments to provide more context. 
 
While email is a time-efficient method, Email Sentiments are trickier to decipher since you can only gather a limited amount of information from text. The available Email Sentiments are more limited and have different choices to provide insight.
