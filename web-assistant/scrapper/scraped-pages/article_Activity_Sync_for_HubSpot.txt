Content
Activity Sync for HubSpot brings the following functionality to Salesloft:
Salesloft People Link to HubSpot Contacts: When you create a Person in Salesloft or execute an activity on an unlinked Person, Salesloft automatically links to a HubSpot Contact with a matching email address. If no match is found, the Person remains unlinked.
Navigate to HubSpot: Once a Salesloft Person links to a HubSpot Contact, Salesloft displays a HubSpot icon under the Person’s name. You can leverage this link to jump directly into the Contact record in HubSpot.
 

 
Activities Log to HubSpot: No action is needed for this step. If applicable, you can see and manage any failed activities from the failed activity log.
Things to Note:
Activity Sync for HubSpot provides activity logging from Salesloft to HubSpot. All activities are logged to the Contact level in HubSpot, but not to the Account or Company Levels.
HubSpot users will need the following permissions in order to successfully authenticate from Salesloft to HubSpot:
Marketing: Lists
CRM: View/Edit Contacts, Companies, and Deals
For additional People and Account data syncing between HubSpot and Salesloft, learn more about the Salesloft and HubSpot integration on the Salesloft App Directory .

Administrative Setup for HubSpot
To set up HubSpot Activity Sync, a team Admin must take the following steps:
Set CRM Type : For the integration to work, you must designate HubSpot as a team’s CRM Type. A team can only have one CRM Type and cannot be integrated with both HubSpot and another CRM. Once you’ve set the CRM Type, any features or settings in Salesloft specific to bidirectional sync or other CRMs (e.g. Sync Management, and Opportunity Field Configuration) will be hidden.
 
Activity Logging : Every Salesloft team can customize which Salesloft activities log to the CRM. By default, all activity types log to the CRM. Admins only need to intervene if there are any activity types that the team does NOT want to log to the CRM. You can manage these settings from the Activity Logging preferences on the CRM Sync Settings page.
 

Things to Note: Activity Field Configuration is not necessary with Activity Sync for HubSpot. HubSpot does not allow users to create custom properties on their engagements (e.g. calls and emails).
 
Linking People: Set this to Contact by clicking the Edit button to ensure Salesloft Activities sync successfully to Hubspot. If Do Not Link is selected, the activities logged in Salesloft won't log into Hubspot and the error Cannot find person in your CRM will appear in the Failed CRM Activity logs.
 
User Setup for HubSpot
Before any user can take advantage of Activity Sync for HubSpot, you must connect your HubSpot account to your Salesloft account. 

Every user must establish a personal CRM connection in order for their activities to log to HubSpot. This is required in order for activities you log in Salesloft to sync to HubSpot.

To establish your personal CRM connection, follow these steps: 
Navigate to the Personal CRM Settings in Salesloft.
Click Connect to launch an authentication flow into HubSpot.
Authorize the connection between Salesloft and HubSpot. Once the connection is made, you will be taken back to your Salesloft Personal Settings.
Things to Note: For most users connected to a CRM, it is recommended to leave the Custom BCC Address empty. For some HubSpot teams, there may be exceptions to this if they have Email/Reply logging disabled.
 
HubSpot Activity Types
Salesloft logs activities under their corresponding activity type in HubSpot. 

All activities logged include the Timestamp (Date/Time activity was executed) and Owner (User that executed the activity). 

The following activity types are included:
