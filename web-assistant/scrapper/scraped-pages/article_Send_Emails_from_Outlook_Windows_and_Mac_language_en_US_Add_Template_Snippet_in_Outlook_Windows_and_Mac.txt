Installing Salesloft Connect for Outlook - Windows and Mac allows you to leverage Salesloft email and templates from your account. This means that you can send emails from Outlook that will log and track messages (if you choose) just like sending them from the Salesloft platform.

The “Loft It” feature in Outlook sends your email, logs the email in Salesloft (and your CRM), and allows you to track your email metrics. 

Things to Note: If you do not wish for the email to be tracked, you can use the normal Outlook Send button to send without syncing it to Salesloft.

To send Salesloft emails from Outlook, you will need to select the Loft It option. Follow these steps to “Loft” your email from Outlook:
Open a new message.
Once your message is ready, hit Loft It, designated by the Salesloft icon, on your toolbar. The Loft It feature allows the email to be tracked for opens, clicks, and replies via the Salesloft platform.
 
Add a Salesloft Template or Snippet in Connect for Outlook - Windows and Mac
Installing Connect for Outlook allows you to leverage the power and features of Salesloft including adding previously created templates or snippets to your emails. Quickly add a template while your composing an email so you use the same consistent messaging, with the added benefit of tracking metrics.

Insert Availability in Connect for Outlook - Windows and Mac
Insert availability streamlines the process of meeting scheduling between you and your buyer by letting you suggest time blocks as proposed meeting times. Not only can you send and book meeting invites, you can also coordinate internal schedules from within your email.

To insert meeting availability times using Connect for Outlook - Office 365, follow these steps:
Open a new message.
Click the Salesloft icon in the bottom right corner. 
From the dropdown menu, click Open Salesloft. The Salesloft Connect side panel will appear.

Using Email Sentiment in Salesloft Connect for Outlook - Windows and Mac
Email Sentiments are qualitative descriptions assigned to your email replies that provide insight into how your message performed. 

An Email Sentiment will be suggested by Salesloft’s Machine Learning algorithm when you open a Lofted email response from a prospect.  The pre-selected sentiment will appear at  the top portion of the response. You can see learn more about the Available Email Sentiments in our Knowledge Base article. 

Things to Note: Email Sentiments only appear for replies to Lofted emails - aka emails sent from the Salesloft platform OR using the Loft It button in Salesoft Connect. 

Each suggested Sentiment contains a brief explanation of why the model assigned the specific sentiment and a Confidence Level. You can view the explanation by hovering over the i icon to the right of the Email Sentiment. The Confidence Level lets you know how sure the model is about the selection so you can also feel confident in that selection. 

You can (and should) review the suggested Email Sentiment when it appears. The Machine Learning algorithm is good, but it can still learn. So, if you see an Email Sentiment assigned that doesn’t match the actual sentiment of the message, the best thing you can do is teach the Machine Learning algorithm by selecting a more appropriate Email Sentiment. 

Things to Note: Any Salesloft user cc’d on the email reply can edit the sentiment. For example, a manager cc’d on emails sent by newer reps can make sure that the Email Sentiment is most accurately showing the rep’s performance..  

When you select a different Email Sentiment, you are editing the Email Sentiment. To edit the Email Sentiment inside Outlook for Windows and Mac, follow these steps: 
Open your email reply. 
Open the Connect for Outlook side panel.
Find the Email Sentiment at the bottom Connect for Outlook side panel. Review the explanation and confidence level. 
Click the name of the Email Sentiment to open the dropdown menu. 
Select the Email Sentiment that is appropriate for your email reply. 
Your new Email Sentiment will be saved and sent to Salesloft Analytics and changes are reflected in charts and reports.
