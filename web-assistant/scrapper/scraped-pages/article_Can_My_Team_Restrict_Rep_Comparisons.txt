If your company policy or regulatory body restricts the ability to let employees compare their performance, also known as "head-to-head comparison," a team Admin can toggle analytics comparisons on or off to support requirements.

An admin will need to manage the permission sets assigned to their user groups. Specifically, they will need to uncheck the View Analytics Permission.  

When unchecked, the following Analytics items will no longer be visible by individual users.

The following Analytics Overview Panel will be hidden:
The Email Leaderboard panel will be hidden
The Call Leaderboard panel will be hidden
The Ranking tab panels will be hidden
Analytics Pages and reports will not be visible where data is grouped and displayed by user. This includes:
The Ranking tab will be inaccessible through the url
The Team Process Report will be inaccessible
The Team Performance Report will be inaccessible
The Email Report will be inaccessible
The Call Report will be inaccessible
The LinkedIn Report will be inaccessible
The Email Sentiment by User Report will be inaccessible
The Call Sentiment by User Report will be inaccessible
The Team Cadence by User Report will be inaccessible
Panel Drill downs that link to user based reports will also be unavailable, including: 
The Email Results Panel should not have a view report link
The Call Results Panel should not have a view report link
The Other Steps Panel should not have a view report link
The LinkedIn Results Panel should not have a view report link
The Team Performance Panel should not have a view report link
The Best Time to Call Panel should not have a view report link
The Cadence Process Panel should not have a view report link
The Email Personalization Panel should not have a view report link

All new panels or reports will be tied to this permission moving forward as of March 2022.
