Templates are created email messages that can be used within Cadences or to simply compose a one-off email with a ready-to-go draft.

Before you can add email templates to emails, you need to create the templates. Creating templates is very similar to drafting an email. With templates, you get the benefit of re-using that email message over and over. The templates you use will gather metrics so you can assess how well a template performs.Â 

In this article, you will learn about creating templates in Salesloft and we will provide some examples, including:Â 
Create a New Template
Create a Team Template
B2B Cold Email Template Examples
Follow Up Email Template Examples
Create a New Template
There are certain email messages you will send over and over like introduction emails, follow-ups, meeting recaps.Â 

These repeated emails are perfect use cases for templates.Â 

To create a template, follow these steps:
Go to theÂ TemplatesÂ page.
In the upper right corner of the page, select CreateÂ Template.
If you have theÂ SalesloftÂ templates permission, you will see a couple options for the type of template you can create. Choose a Personal Template or Team Template.Â 
Once youâ€™ve accessed the Create Template box, the first thing you will do is give your template aÂ Name.
Add yourÂ Subject Line.
Draft your email. The body of your email will be laid out here. Just like when you are composing an email from your email server, Salesloft provides you with additional email features that can empower your messages like addingÂ Dynamic FieldsÂ or gifs. You can learn more about editing your template inÂ The Email Window ToolbarÂ article.Â 
From the preview window, send yourself a preview of the email if you would like to see how it will appear to your recipients.
AddÂ TagsÂ at the bottom of the email message for quick filtering after the template is saved.
ClickÂ Save.
Create a Team Template
Team templates allow you to share unified messaging that is scalable across your entire team. In other words, your whole team can leverage the exact same email messages.Â 

Salesloft admins can control and quickly distribute messaging to your entire team by using team templates. Your reps will all have access to the same approved messaging that they can easily use when reaching out to their prospects.

Things to Note: Â 
Only Salesloft admins or users with the Manage Team Templates permission can create, edit, copy, or archive a team template.
Any changes made to a team template will be time stamped with the date and by user made the changes.
When a team template is updated, it is updated across the entire platform, with users seeing the changes immediately.
Team template metrics are aggregated across the entire team.
To create a team template, follow these steps:
Go to theÂ Templates Page
SelectÂ Create Template. Â 
If you have theÂ templates permissions enabled for your role, you will have the option of creating aÂ PersonalÂ orÂ Team Template. SelectÂ Team. HitÂ Next.
Create your template. When creating a team template, you have the same functionality and user experience as when creating a personal template.
Save the template. Users will now be able to find it under their Team Templates.Â
