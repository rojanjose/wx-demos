Inactive Accounts mean that your Salesloft login access has been removed. 

When you attempt to login after your account has been deactivated, you will see an error message. Click Log Out to return to the sign in page.
 
To reinstate your subscription, contact your team admin to confirm why your account is currently inactive. Based on the response, reach out to the appropriate Salesloft contact: 
If a team admin moves you from the active users list to an inactive user, reach out to your team admin to activate your account. If your admin is unable to reactivate your license, Contact Support. 
If your subscription has been cancelled by your company's decision contact the Salesloft Billing department. To reach the Billing department, click the Contact Support button in the Help Center. When you enter your case, set the type of case to Billing . 
If your subscription has been cancelled due to nonpayment, contact the Salesloft Accounts Receivable department.
If your trial has expired, contact your Salesloft Account Manager.
