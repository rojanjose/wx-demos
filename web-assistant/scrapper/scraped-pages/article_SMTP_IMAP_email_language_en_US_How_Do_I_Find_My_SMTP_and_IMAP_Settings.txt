SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) configurations are settings Salesloft uses to send emails on your behalf and check replies.

SMTP applies to outgoing mail settings (i.e. sends), while IMAP is used for incoming settings (i.e.replies). 

In this article, you will find the answers to common errors you may encounter with SMTP and IMAP configurations, along with some tips and resources to help you troubleshoot, including:

How Do I Find My SMTP and IMAP Settings?
SMTP and IMAP are email protocols that allow applications, like Salesloft, to securely send email and track the replies to those emails through your Exchange mail server.  

If you haven't set up an SMTP/IMAP connection before, your company's IT representative is probably the best person to provide you with the information you'll need to configure Cadence to send through your Exchange account.

Below is a list of technical requirements that will help your IT admin get you the necessary configuration information and, if necessary, open the proper ports on your mail server.

What information will be helpful for my IT admin?

Printable version of these requirements
SMTP
Host name for the SMTP Server
Login name & password for the user's Exchange account.
An open SSL SMTP Port
* Typical port numbers: 587 or 25 (with STARTTLS)  
IMAP
Host name for the IMAP Server
Login name & password for the user's account.
An open SSL IMAP Port
* Typical port number: 993 or 143
UIDPLUS
Cadence requires “UIDPLUS” to be enabled on your mail server for it’s core functionality.  Please verify with your IT team that it is enabled. You will receive a “IMAP Server is not supported” error if it is not enabled.

Please note: you must be using Exchange 2010 SP1 or newer. Exchange 2003, 2007 and 2010 do not support the IMAP UIDPLUS extension and therefore cannot integrate with Salesloft.
Which Salesloft IP Addresses Should I Whitelist?

If your team blocks inbound communication to your SMTP or Exchange Server, you (or your IT) need to whitelist Salesloft IP addresses in order to connect.

Things to Note: Whitelisting Salesloft IP addresses is primarily for any customers with Exchange / SMTP Servers that are behind a firewall that doesn’t allow outside connection.

The table below lists public IP addresses for IMAP/SMTP email integration and API access. Reach out to your Salesloft customer service representative to learn which region your team is in. Based on your region, whitelist the following IP addresses:
 

US1	US2	US3	US4	EU1
54.163.237.178	3.83.196.94	35.184.122.213	34.85.255.113	34.141.56.47

[Error Message] Invalid Server or Port
The port numbers provided to Salesloft are incorrect.

Verify your port numbers with your IT administrator.
[Error Message] Email Client Not Configured
An error occurred while sending your email batch. This is usually due to a temporary connection issue with your mail server.

To solve the connection issue, re-verify and save your SMPT/IMAP protocols by navigating to your Personal Settings then Emails. Once your protocols are re-verified, you can attempt your email send again.
[Error Message] Problem with IMAP Server
Your company mail server is not configured properly to integrate with Salesloft.

Confirm with your IT administrator that your email server is configured correctly. These settings are found in the Email tab of your Personal Settings.
[Error Message] This IMAP Server is Not Supported
UIDPLUS is not enabled or advertised as available. UIDPLUS is required for Salesloft functionality.

Ask your IT administrator to verify you are on the minimum version of Exchange 2013 and enable the UIDPLUS extension in order to be compatible with Salesloft.
