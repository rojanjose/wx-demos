Permissions let admins control what users can see and do in Salesloft. You can define a specific set of permissions for each role. The default Admin and User permissions cannot be edited.  

When you first visit this page, the Admin and User default roles will be visible. You can change these to display up to any four roles for side-by-side comparison. To view different roles on the permission page, click the role name in the column header and select an alternative role in the dropdown.  

You can edit any custom roles by checking or unchecking the box related to that particular object's permissions.

There’s a wide range of permissions available to you in Salesloft. You can pick and choose from any of the permissions listed.
