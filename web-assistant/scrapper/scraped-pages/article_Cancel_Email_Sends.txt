Have you ever hit Send on email and then immediately caught a typo? It happens to the best of us. For moments like these, you can cancel pending and scheduled email sends from the Emails page. Cancelling a send will stop the email from sending.

Pending messages include those emails that are in line to be sent soon. Typically, this means you have a relatively short window to cancel a pending send. If you're really worried and anticipate wanted to cancel emails often, we recommend asking your team admin to increase the email delay so you have a little more time. 

Scheduled emails include sends that you program to send at a later set time. Scheduled sends can be configured on a one-off basis, in bulk from a Cadence, or even automated from a Cadence. 

Whether the email is scheduled or pending, you can cancel an in-progress send from the Emails page. Follow these instructions to cancel an email: 

1. Go to the Emails Page. 

2. In the Emails list, find and select the email(s) you wish to cancel. When you select an email, options will appear at the top of the list. 
 
 

3. Click Cancel Send. A message will appear to confirm the cancel.
 

4. Click Cancel Send to confirm the action. The email status will update to Canceled.
