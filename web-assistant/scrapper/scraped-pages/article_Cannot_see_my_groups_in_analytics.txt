The ability to view Groups and other individual teammates is managed by the Filter by Teammates permission. This permission is enabled for the Salesloft admin role and disabled for the Salesloft user role by default. 

If you would like to see Group analytics, but are assigned the default Salesloft user role, reach out to a team admin. They will need to create a new role with the Filter by Teammates permission enabled. Once that permission is created, they can assign that role to you and you will be able to view Group analytics.
