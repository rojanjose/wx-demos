Conversations makes it easy to track all of your recordings from one convenient location. You can use recordings to pinpoint what’s working in your sales call, or quickly address struggles like filler words (ex: "like"). 

Once meetings are Scheduled, In Progress, or completed Recordings, there are a number of general actions you can take to manage your meetings the way you want to. 

In this article, you will learn about the different actions that apply to the Conversations tabs, including:

Upload a Recording
Search Recordings
Edit Meeting Details
Share the Recording
Add Attendee
Manage Playlist
Download Transcript
Download Video
Link Recording to a Person
Link Recording to an Account
Link Recording to an Opportunity
Delete a Recording
Upload a Recording

Conversations is designed to capture meetings that include the bot. But if you are new to Salesloft's Conversations or the bot misses a call, there may be some recordings left out of the platform.

Uploading a recording allows you to manually add the video and audio recordings into Salesloft. Once recordings are uploaded, they can be stored, sorted, tagged, notated, clipped, scanned for trackers, and transcribed. In other words, Conversation's many features apply to any uploaded recording.

The following file types may be uploaded:

Audio - mp3, wav, ogg, m4a
Video - mp4, m4v, mov

Things to Note:

File size limit: 3gb
Due to the nature of an uploaded file, active speaker detection (ASD) and percent talk time for speakers are unavailable.
Recordings must be at least 60 seconds long.

To upload a recording to Conversations, follow these steps:

Go to the Conversations Recordings tab.
In the upper right corner, click Upload a Recording. The Upload a Recording window will appear.
Enter a Meeting Title.
Set the Meeting Organizer by finding a name in the dropdown menu.
Set the Meeting Date.
Drag the file into the Upload a Recording window. Or select a file from the window.
Click Upload.
Search Recordings

The Conversations search bar makes it easy to find specific recordings you may want to review or reference.

To use the search, simply type a word or phrase in the search bar and hit enter.

Search in Options

The Search in options help to refine your search. You may select multiple search in options. The options include:

All: searches all of the available recordings
Comments: searches for the word or phrase that are in the meeting's comments
Title: searches for words specific to the meeting name. 
Transcription: looks for words that are mentioned in the transcription
Showing 

The Showing line lets you know how many recordings you are viewing. Once the search or filter has been set, the total number of recordings will reflect the number that fits the search or filter.

Link Recording to a Person

The meetings you host are most likely (hopefully) with people who have been previously imported into Salesloft. When this is the case, link the Person to the recording.

Linking a person creates a link to that Person's profile page. Once a person is linked to a recording you can quickly jump to the profile page and view all the relevant person information or take additional person actions.

To link a person to the recording, follow these steps: 

Use the search and filter options to find your meeting (if applicable).
Click the ellipses icon in the upper right corner of the recording panel.
Under the Link section, select Person.
In the Link Person window, begin typing the name of the Salesloft Person in the text box.
The dropdown will expand with search options. Select the person you with to link to.
Click Link.
A Linked To: detail will appear in the recording info. The person's name will appear as a blue link to the person's profile page.
Link Recording to an Account

Linking your recording to an account creates a link to The Account Profile Page. Once an account is linked to a recording you can quickly jump to the account page and view all the relevant account information or take additional actions.

To link an account to the recording, follow these steps: 

Use the search and filter options to find your meeting (if applicable).
Click the ellipses icon in the upper right corner of the recording panel.
Under the Link section, select Account.
In the Link Account window, begin typing the name of the Salesloft Account in the text box.
The dropdown will expand with search options. Select the account you with to link to.
Click Link.
A Linked To: detail will appear in the recording info. The account's name will appear as a blue link to the account's profile page.

 

 
Link Recording to an Opportunity

Linking your recording to an opportunity creates a link to an opportunity in Salesforce. Once an opportunity is linked to a recording, you can leverage information or take additional actions on the opportunity while you view your recording.

To link an opportunity to the recording, follow these steps: 

Use the search and filter options to find your meeting (if applicable).
Click the ellipses icon in the upper right corner of the recording panel.
Under the Link section, select Link to Opportunity.
In the Link to Account and Opportunity window, you will need to enter the Account name first, since Opportunities must be associated so an Account. Begin typing the name of the Salesloft Account in the text box.
Once the Account name is selected, you can enter a name in the Opportunity field. The Opportunity order of appearance in the drop-down button is determined by the furthest Opportunity Close Date on top of the list. A tooltip explains the Opportunity list order. Select an opportunity from the list. 
Click Link. The Opportunity name will now appear in the Linked to area. 
Delete a Recording

Deleting a recording will remove it entirely from the Salesloft database.

Things to Note: Delete Recordings is an available Salesloft permission. If you do not see the Delete option, contact your Salesloft admin about adding the feature to your role.
