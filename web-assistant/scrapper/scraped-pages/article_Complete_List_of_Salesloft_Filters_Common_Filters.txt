The Salesloft Pages include a number of standard filters that are included in all Salesloft instances. The sections described in this article explain the standard filters. The filters include a label in italics for Default or Add Filter to designate if the filter is on the page by default or if the filter must be added.

Common Filters

 

Owner Filter

The Owner filter alters your list based on the user who is assigned the actions related to the Person. The owner defaults to the user who imported the record or performed the action unless reassigned.

Filtering by owner allows you to view which records are owned by yourself and/or different users on your team. 

The Owner filter includes the following options: 

You: Shows only the Cadences you have created
All Users: Shows every record that has been created by your team from both active and inactive users.
Active Users: Shows the records of all users that are currently active in Salesloft.
Inactive Users*: Shows the records for any users that have been switched to Inactive by an admin. Inactive users include people who are no longer with your organization or no longer using their Salesloft account.
No Owner**: Filters Accounts based on those that do not have an owner assigned to them. 
Specific User: Allows you to see the Cadences created by a specific user on your team.
Specific Groups***: Shows the select activity of Salesloft users that belong to a specific group. Groups are set by admins.

The Owner filter is available on the follows Salesloft pages:

Cadence People tab

Templates
Conversations Recordings

Things to Note:
* Inactive Users do not appear in the Conversations Recording filters
** No Owner is exclusive to the Accounts Page filters.
*** Specific Groups only appear in the Snippets and Conversations Recordings filters. 

Close Date Filter

The Deal Close Date is the date or time frame in which an opportunity is expected to close. You can use the Close Date filter to find opportunities that are expected to close.

The Close Date filter includes the following options: 

All
This Month
This Calendar Quarter
Next Month
Next Calendar Quarter
Custom Time Range: Click in the date range box to make the calendar appear. Then, select the start of the range, followed by the end of the range.

You can find the Close Date filter on the following Salesloft pages: 

Deals Pipeline View Filters
Forecast Filters
Deals Analytics Filters
Date Filter

The Date filters show data for a selected period of time. There are two types of data filters you can use:

Relative date: Defined periods of time. Examples of Relative Dates include Week to Date, Month to Date, Quarter to Date, and Year to Date.
Custom date range: Manually selected time frame. 

When you view date filters on the Analytics Overview page, you will also see comparative data to a prior period. The prior period will be different for a relative date range versus a custom date range.

Viewing your data over a specific time period allows you to see progress over the course of a month, a quarter, or dwindle the record down to see how your engagement has been on this very day.

Things to Note: Many Salesloft pages use a variation of the Date filter. Since the filter name and default date ranges are different, those filters are explained in their filter area (example Account Page Filters - Date Added). 

The Date filter includes the following options: 

Today * : Shows your analytics report for this calendar day. The report starts at 12:00 am. The data shown will include all data that has been collected.
Yesterday * : Shows your analytics reported during the previous day. All days of the week apply (including weekend).
Last 7 Days: (Default time range) Shows your analytics report over the last seven days, including the current day.
Last 30 Days: Shows your analytics report over the last 30 days, including the current day.
Last 90 Days: Shows your analytics report over the last 90 days, including the current day.
Last Month: This shows the metrics of the prior, or last, month based on the current month. For example, if the current date is in July, then Last Month will filter results for June.
Week to Date: See data only for the current week.
Things to Note: The week always starts with Monday.
Month to Date: Shows progress for the current month. This includes from the first of the month to the current date. 
Quarter to Date: Summarizes results for the current calendar quarter and offers a comparison to the prior quarter. Quarters are as follows:
January, February and March
April, May and June
July, August and September
October, November and December
Year to Date: Summarizes results since January 1st of the current year and offers a comparison of Year over Year results.
Things to Note: This is a calendar year to date and not a fiscal year to date.
Custom: Allows you to pick the specific date range for your analytics report. When you select Custom, the filter box will expand. Select the date box to view a calendar and choose your date range.

You can filter by time range from the following Salesloft pages: 

Analytics:  Overview, Reports, and Ranking tabs.
Cadence Activity: By default, your Cadence Activity dashboard shows data for the previous seven days. 

Things to Note:

The Start Date and End Date will adjust to the date option you select. 
Cadence activity does not run on weekends, unless you have automated an email step to send on weekends. By default, weekends will not be included in the Cadence Activity charts. To view weekend data, select the Include Saturday and Sunday checkbox in the Date filter. 
The hours correlate directly to the time zone set on your computer. 
Salesloft will only display data that has been collected for the day. Data for the current or an upcoming hour may take some time to load. 

* While most filters break down to show the number of emails or calls made on a given day, the individual day filters (Today and Yesterday) break down activity by the hour. 

Stage Filter

The Stage filter defines your listview by where a record is in your sales process or whatever segments are defined by your team’s Stage settings.

Stages may be identified by the record type (i.e. Person Stage)

The Conversations Pages and Deals Pipeline View Stages come from Salesforce Opportunity Stage which is synced to to Salesloft.

Stages will vary based on your team’s assigned stages.

You can find the Stage filter on the following Salesloft pages:  

Cadence People tab
Accounts Page
People Page

Tag Filter

Users can filter by a particular Tag. Tags act like labels or buckets of similar records. They are created by a team admin in the Tag Settings

Tags can be created, removed, or edited from the Record’s Page actions or a Profile page. 

Available tags will vary since they are created by your team admin.

All tags created by your admin will appear as filter options to select. If you select a tag that has not been assigned, your listview will result in “No Matches.”

You can filter by Tag from the following Salesloft pages: 

Cadences Page
Cadence People tab

You can find the Archived filter on the following Salesloft pages:

Trackers are determined by a team admin in your Conversations Settings.

Things to note: We recommend that you only update filters inside their filter category. If you select the language using the Tracker Group filter, and then try to choose a different language inside the Language filter, the results will show No matching recordings found. This is because the logic of a single filter cannot be found. If this happens, reset your filters and specify the Language filter followed by the Tracker Filter.

Deals Pipeline View Filters
The Pipeline Dashboard will bring in all of the data related to your team's Opportunities. While having everything may sound nice, it's overwhelming for our eyes and minds to take in all of that information and may not ultimately fit your needs. This is where Dashboard filtering comes into place. 

Pipeline Dashboard filters allow you to drill down the list of Deals you are viewing based off of certain criteria.
Owners Filter
Default

The Deals Owners filter refers to the Salesforce Opportunity owner. This filter breaks down Deals by the team member or groups of team members who are in charge of that Opportunity. Typically, this is the user who is working on the Deal or originally created the Opportunity. 

You can use the filter to see a range of Opportunities based on your entire team, certain members of your team, specific groups from your team (determined by your teams Groups set up), or Opportunities that are owned by you.
You: Filter results based on the Opportunities that are owned by you, aka the logged-in user.
All Owners: Filters results based on the Opportunities that are owned by all team members.

You can use the Forecast Dashboard filters to refine the data shown on the Forecast Dashboard based on the Deal Owner and the Deal Close Date. 

Owner Filter
Default 

An Owner in Salesloft is the person who is working on a particular deal. By default, the Forecast Dashboard shows your entire team’s goals and forecast metrics, however, you can use the Owner filter to find opportunities that are owned by a specific person.

The Forecast Owner Filter includes the following options:
My Team (default)
Specific User: When you select the Specific User option, you can search for a member of your team by typing their name into the Select User bar. When you search for a Specific User, their name will appear along with their direct and indirect reports–depending on their hierarchy. Once you select a user, you will see the data for that user and their direct and indirect reports. 
Deals Analytics Filters

The Deals Analytics Filters allow you to select the data sets you want to view inside the Analytics for Deals. 

Owner Filter
Default

The Deals Owner filter presents which individual or group whose data you would like to view. The Owner is based on the Owner fields inside Salesforce. So, if the records being displayed are opportunities, the Opportunity Owner will determine whose data is shown. 

The Deals Owner filter includes the following options:
You: Filter results based on the Opportunities that are owned by you, aka the logged-in user.
All Owners: Filters results based on the Opportunities that are owned by all team members.

Coaching Filters

The Coaching filters allow you to drill down into more granular information. 

Group Filter 


The group filter is only available on the Coaching Team View page. The filter selects one or more groups.

The group filter is particularly useful to help refine the list of users. Let’s say you manage a region of sales reps that are all groups in Team 1. Within that group, you have a bunch of child groups that segment your reps into subregions. if you want to only see users in one of the subregions, use the filter to select the child group, and only those users will be visible. 

By default, the Coaching Team View will show the group that you are assigned to and the list of users also assigned to that group.

User Filter

Allows Admins and managers to switch between different users from the individual summary page. Standard Salesloft users do not have this permission enabled by default to maintain privacy between reps. 

Things to Note: Available to users with the Team View permission only

Date Filter

The Coaching Date filter defines the time period of the data that is viewed. 

Things to Note: Weekends are included in the Coaching Date filter.

This filter affects the data as well as the percent change. One example of the Percentage Change example is when filtered to This Month, the percent change is between the same days last month as this month. When filtered to Last Month, the percent change is between the last full month and the month prior to that.

The date filter in Coaching includes the following options: 

Last Week
Last Month
Last Quarter
This Week
This Month
This Quarter

The Coaching Recordings Filter includes the following options:

CRM Activities Log Filters

The filters help you quickly identify potential errors that could negatively impact your sync longs. If you notice errors occur for a collection (or large amount) of logs, you can use the error messages to help resolve the issue. 

Date Filter
Default

The Failed CRM Activities Date filter lets you view the failed CRM activities by the date the log was attempted. This is particularly helpful if any error occurred on a certain date and you would only like to see those records or you want to see the number of logs that took place during a period of time.

Things to Note:
Admins only
Admins can select a date range of up to 90 days in the past.

The CRM Activities Log Date filter options include: 
Today
Last 2 Days
Last 7 Days
Last 14 Days
Last 30 Days
Last 60 Days
Last 90 Days
Custom Date Range: Enter the Start and End dates for the range you would like to see.
 
Error Filter
Default

The Error Theme filter categorizes sync errors into various error themes. This way, you can select a theme and view any errors that fit the error classification. When you filter by an error theme, you gain visibility into how big or small an issue is. You can also gain further understanding into the reason an error is happening across a series of logs.

To apply the Error Theme filter, search and/or select for a certain theme from the Error Theme dropdown. Once you click a theme, the filter will be applied to the list.
