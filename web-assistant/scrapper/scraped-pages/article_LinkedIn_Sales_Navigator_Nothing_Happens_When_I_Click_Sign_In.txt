If nothing happens when you click the blue sign in button in the LinkedIn panel, the culprit is most likely a pop up blocker. 

Make sure the pop up blocker is turned off in your Chrome browser window. If popups are blocked, click the icon in the url bar at the far right and allow popups for Salesloft.
