It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: [Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook](/docs).\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful.

Are you going to schedule the initial call or do you want us to schedule it. Who should be invited ?\n\nDo you plan to have a weekly/bi weekly call for feedback?\n\n\nRegards,\nJosh\n\nOutput:\nJosh wants to know who should be on the call, who will schedule it and at what frequency. Peter responded saying that we should have a 1 hour call with Ravi and we can have a regular connect.\n\nInput:\nHi Leslie, \nYes, once the final deliverable is determined, we will share it with Ravi. However, Milestone 1 is not going to be our Beta release deliverable. We are still implementing the new APIs we want to have for Beta. So, I am guessing this is just to get Ravi started with product runtime container? We expect it will change a lot in next few weeks.\n\nBest Regards,\nKrista\n\nHi Krista and Scott, I understand we have very minor work left for milestone 1 features. Could you please share the final milestone 1 containers with Ravi so that he can build the beta/demo/preview environment for us? We're doing it this way instead of a regular beta. Thanks! Ravi,  moving forward shall we have a weekly chat to touch base?\n\nLeslie C.
